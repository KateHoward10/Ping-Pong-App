# Ping-Pong-App

This is my attempt at the technical challenge set by DevelopMe at the end of their Coding Fellowship. It is an app built with React/Redux, designed to generate random pairings for a Ping Pong Tournament.


## The brief

"The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.

It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:
ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
continued rounds until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other)."


## Initial Planning

To begin with, in the absence of a  reliable Internet connection, I made some wireframes for the project (pics to follow) and worked out a basic schedule. I decided to make the project in ReactJS, which I did struggle with when we started learning it on the course (especially with Redux, and the structure of the whole system), but it was also one of the most recent topics covered and seemed to be quite suitable for this sort of project. Now I feel much more comfortable working with React so I'm glad I made this decision.

With ten full days in which to complete the challenge, my plan was to follow these steps in approximately this order:
1. Wireframing, work out the basic structure of the app.
2. Set up components and get the app to store/display players' names.
3. Work out the logic for randomising and pairing players.
4. Attempt to generate further rounds of the tournament.
5. Validation - check if the number of players is a power of 2?
6. Styling.
7. Write up.
8. Upload.
